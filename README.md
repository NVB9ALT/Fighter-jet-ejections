# Fighter-jet-ejections

This adds an implementation of ejection seats in fighter jets. If you turn the engine off in midair (press E), you will be ejected from the aircraft and switched to a paraglider automatically.

This is a beta addon and there are still a few things I need to streamline; please keep that in mind. This will eventually be put in the realism addon.

Planned features:
- Cockpit canopy will be blown off when ejection is triggered </br>
- Smoother ejection </br>
